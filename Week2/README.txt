The files Conversion.c and Sum.c contain solutions for Week 2 practicals.

The file Conversion.c uses the ceil function and logf to count the number of binary digits

The file Sum.c compares values of a Harmonic Progression sum when calculated using different parameters in the for loop. The results do not contain any major difference and are very comparable
